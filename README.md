# Getting Started

Follow along step by step to create the github battle app.  The steps to build the app are seperated into branches.
To get started at the beginning, once the app is installed on your local machine, point your terminal to the project root and 
```bash
git checkout --track origin/step-0
```
Do this through the last step, step-06.

I also created some codepens to practice passing props: [Here](https://codepen.io/duggiemitchell/pen/qoqORQ?editors=1010), [here](https://codepen.io/duggiemitchell/pen/zWovza) and [here](https://codepen.io/duggiemitchell/pen/oqYjeV)
